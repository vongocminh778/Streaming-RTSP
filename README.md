# Streaming-IP-Cameras-Using-PyQt-and-OpenCV
This project shows how to create a security camera system using OpenCV to stream IP cameras 
and PyQt to create the graphical interface (GUI).

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library.
In this project OpenCV is used to read the frames from an IP camera.

PyQt connects the Qt C++ cross-platform framework with the Python language, it is a GUI module.
This module takes care of the graphical interface and layout each camera in a grid layout.
